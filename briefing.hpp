		New tasks will be assigned via radio. You can either accept the mission when the radio message comes in at the main base radio in the <marker name='TOUR_Mkr_radio'>comms room</marker> or the radio man will have an option to turn on the radio, when he has a radioman backpack equiped. A maximum of 3 tasks can run concurrently at any one time.
		<br/>
		<br/>		
		The radio man can also listen to comms chatter from local enemy forces, as can anyone by the radio in the main base. While the comms chatter is minimal, the chances are they are planning nothing. As the chatter increases over time, there is a high probability the enemy activity to rapidly increase.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		You will need food and water rations when out on patrol. This mission enables the ACE feature for food and drink.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		You can utilise all or some of your forces in completing tasks. But remember a key task is to guard the main base. If enemy go inside you will fail the mission.
		<br/>
		<br/>		
		Local civilians and mitilia's are friendly in general. Do not kill them, otherwise you will fail the protec civilian task. Only shoot at hostile threats. But be warned. Friendly militia can soon change sides.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		When equiped with a radioman backpack you can access the support menu to use artillery and air support. The chinook can be used to transport prisoners or players to and from the airbase for medical treatment.
