		New tasks will be assigned via radio. You can either accept the mission when the radio message comes in at the main base radio in the <marker name='TOUR_Mkr_radio'>comms room</marker> or the radio man will have an option to turn on the radio, when he has a radioman backpack equiped. A maximum of 3 tasks can run concurrently at any one time.
		<br/>
		<br/>		
		The radio man can also listen to comms chatter from local enemy forces, as can anyone by the radio in the main base. While the comms chatter is minimal, the chances are they are planning nothing. As the chatter increases over time, there is a high probability the enemy activity to rapidly increase.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		You will need food and water rations when out on patrol. This mission enables the ACE feature for food and drink.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		You can utilise all or some of your forces in completing tasks. But remember a key task is to guard the main base. If enemy go inside you will fail the mission.
		<br/>
		<br/>		
		Local civilians and mitilia's are friendly in general. Do not kill them, otherwise you will fail the protec civilian task. Only shoot at hostile threats. But be warned. Friendly militia can soon change sides.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		When equiped with a radioman backpack you can access the support menu to use artillery and air support. The chinook can be used to transport prisoners or players to and from the airbase for medical treatment.

		<br/>
		2nd Battalion, The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment    19/06/13
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Last month the Scots Guards rounded off their tour here in Afghanistan by taking advantage of the winter lull in fighting and pushing forward into Taliban-occupied territory to occupy and fortify several compounds in the region. <marker name='TOUR_Mkr_FOB'>This </marker> unholiest corner of God's fucking creation will be home to you shaggers for the remainder of our operational deployment here in Afghanistan.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		As you may know our arrival here coincides with the start of the fighting season and the locals aren't the kind to pop 'round  around with tea and biscuits to welcome us to their lovely neighbourhood. In fact Terry Taliban's been all over ICOM chatting about their plans to attack this place and send us all home in boxes. Naturally, we do not plan on cooperating.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Our mission here is to hold <marker name='TOUR_Mkr_FOB'>FOB Mikis</marker> and use this location as a springboard to carry out further tasks within the local area, all of which will build towards the larger objective of diminishing and eventually neutralizing the enemy presence here and help bring the province into the fold of the Afghan government.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Remember your drills: Maintain your weapon, your kit and yourself in that order. Be mindful that many here are armed, therefore a male carrying a weapon cannot be regarded as an enemy threat for that reason alone. Lastly keep an ear on the <marker name='TOUR_Mkr_Radio'>net</marker> for further orders from Company Headquarters.
